**Objective**

- Train and Evaluate different DNN Models for plant deasise detection Problem

- To tackle the problem of scarce real-life representative data, experiment with different generative networks and generate more plant leaf image data

- Implement segmentation pipeline to avoid missclassification due to unwanted input

**Approches for Solving the papers realtime Detection Problem**
>>>>>>> 3deaa1e... Update README.md:README.md

phase 1 : [implement the paper](https://github.com/singnet/plant-disease-experiments/tree/master/Plant_Disease_Detection_Benchmark_models) 

phase 2 : do analysis on the paper and identify the type of data problem 

phase 3 : [experement and if possible generate Apprprate data
		  using the data train the model again](https://github.com/singnet/plant_disease_experements/tree/master/Plant_Disease_Detection_gan_experimants)

# Project Structure

**Plant_Disease_Detection_Benchmark_models**

- Train and test different prediction models to get a baseline accuracy to compare to and see progress

**Plant_Disease_Detection_gan_experiments**

- experiment with different generative networks to see their generative capability and if the output can be used to train more robust models

**leaf-image-segmentation-segnet**

- segmentation pipline using VGGSegNet Architecture

# Usage

	Python main.py [--image  IMAGE FILE] [--segment BOOLIAN PARAMETER] [--species SPECIES TYPE]

	arguments

		- --image       loaction of the image
		- --segment     True to  Segment before prediction , False not to 
		- --species     one of the Following Specious :  Apple,Cherry,Corn, Grape,Peach, Pepper,Potato,Strawberry, Sugercane, Tomato
		- --model       what models do you want to use VGG or Inception_V3



# Examples


		 >>  python main.py --image "test/a.jpg"
		 >>  python main.py --image "test/a.jpg" --segment True
		 >>  python main.py --image "test/a.jpg" --species "Apple"
         >>  python main.py --image "test/a.jpg" --segment True --species "Apple"


- before using that make sure you download the weights from    [here for VGG Models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AufdWYl-TfeicAmaweq6Gd8q3--vuBfA/view?usp=sharing) [here for Inception_V3]() and extract all and put it in Plant_Disease_Detection_Benchmark_models/Models/  folder 
		
- This will segment the image and predict the output class based on that . segmented image will be saved as the file name with "_masked" prefix.


- the images are traine with segmented network and lower performance on unsegmented dataset is expected 

-  You can cheack the segmentation accuracy from saved image
